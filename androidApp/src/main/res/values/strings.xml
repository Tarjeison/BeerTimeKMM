    <string name="info_what_is_bac_title">What is Blood Alcohol Content (BAC)?</string>
    <string name="info_what_is_bac_text">BAC is a measurement of the alcohol percentage present in 100mL of blood. A BAC of 0.10% indicates that a person has 0.10g per 100mL of blood. BAC is usually measured in percent or permille depening on the country. This app uses permille and 0.1% = 1‰. \n \n https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content</string>
    <string name="info_how_calculator_title">How does the calculator work?</string>
    <string name="info_how_calculator_text">The number of grams of alcohol needed to achieve a certain blood alcohol content (BAC) can be calculated by using ones biological gender and weight. This app uses the Widmark-Forumla as the basis for the computation, solving for the number of units needed based on wanted BAC and estimated time. \n\n This gives the following equation:\n Needed Grams = (BAC + 0.015*Hours)*(Weight*GenderConstant) \n The amount of alcohol in your selected unit will then be used to see how many units will give the closest value, below or equal, to the grams calculated in the formula above. \n\n https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Blood-Alcohol-Content-(Widmark-Formula)</string>
    <string name="info_custom_drinks_title">Can I add my favorite drinks to the app?</string>
    <string name="info_custom_drinks_text">Sure! Go to Profile and you can add as many drinks as you want. When selecting the metrics for alcohol, make sure you don’t count the volume of non-alcohol beverages such as soda.</string>
    <string name="info_why_not_more_title">Why does the Blood Alcohol Content bar stop at 0.15%?</string>
    <string name="info_why_not_more_text">Legal reason? Moral reasons? Nah, really, if you want to get drunk I bet you won’t need app for that. This app it to help out those looking for more controlled fun.</string>

    <string name="info_how_does_this_app_work">How does this app work?</string>
    <string name="info_how_does_this_app_work_text">Before you start drinking you will have to select the following values: \n\n - Wanted blood alcohol content (BAC) \n\n - How long you will be drinking \n\n - When you want to reach your BAC target \n\n - The drink you\'re planning to drink.  \n\nFor instance, say you\'re planning to drink for 7 hours and reach a BAC of 1‰. You might also want to reach your BAC target before the 7 hours has gone, no problem; just set the time for when you want to reach your BAC taget to e.g. 3 hours. \n\nSelecting a drink might seem difficult, what if you want to switch between different drinks? Well, honestly, it doesn\'t matter that much. The calculation made based on the grams of alcohol in your selected drink, so e.g. if you swap a small beer with a glass of wine you probably won\'t be that of (unless your glass fits a bottle of wine that is). You could find a \"standard\" unit for your country and select that as your drink for the night. \n\nEnjoy!</string>
